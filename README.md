# AITA
AITA stands for "An Introduction to APIs". This website aims to give a basic understand how an API work and letting users try out various APIs on the site as well.
 
## Design Process
As an informative website giving informative about APIs on an introductory level, as such, animations will be an essential part of the design implementation for users understand the content visually. AITA also provides ready to use APIs for users to have a more experential learning.

**Example Scenario (May not be the most accurate)**
> 1. Students like Lester or Keng Shion, as IT students coming across a new topic like API.<br>
> 2. Feeling blur like sotong after lesson and even googling does not help.
> 3. Stumbled across this website after seeing the beautiful landing page filled with animations, the students suddenly got a better understanding.
> 4. Finally after playing the games these students have finally grasp the basic concept of API!

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
